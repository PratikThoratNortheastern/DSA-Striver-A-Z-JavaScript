/* 
Optimal approach: By Striver (Not me)
 Using Euclideanâ€™s theorem.

Intuition: Gcd is the greatest number which is divided by both a and b.If a number is divided by both a and b, it is should be divided by (a-b) and b as well.

Approach:

Recursively call gcd(b,a%b) function till the base condition is hit.
b==0 is the base condition.When base condition is hit return a,as gcd(a,0) is equal to a.
