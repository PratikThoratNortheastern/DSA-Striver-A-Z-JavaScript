Basic 1.1 is not covered here since the concepts are same for all langauges with slight differences in syntax.
Essentially they are concepts such as:
1. Input/Output
2. Functions
3. Arrays and String
4. Switch Statements and Conditional Statements
5. Loops
So on and so forth

This repository will have all solutions in JavaScript
